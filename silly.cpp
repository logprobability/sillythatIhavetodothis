// If you find this file because you're looking at my github activity, you have done more than 99% of people who will look at streak alone.
// That means you're not who this is for (unless in the future it does something silly like the name suggests and you like that kind of thing).

// Ideas I have for what this file might be:
//  - algorithm practice for leetcode type problems (but done backwards, going through std::algorithms, back into popular problem types)
//  - a workflow-based approach to testing atypical index datastructures. 

// I've decided to go with the former for now
